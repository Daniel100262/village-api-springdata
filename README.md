# DevInHouse Village API (Refactored)

This is an API for registering and consulting the residents of a village, as well as generating a financial report, using Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring Security and Spring Data, now refactored to work with Spring Data, Hibernate, RabbitMQ, JUnit and Mockito

## ðŸš€ Running the application

To run this project, it is necessary to follow the step by step below:

1 - Run the **dbcrete.sql** SQL script to create the database

2 - Run the Spring Boot Application to create database tables and relationships

3 - Run the **populate-db.sql** SQL script to populate database with initial data

4 - Make a request to the endpoint **/login** with the email **admin@company.com** and the password **S2jx6uTbnCi*** and get the Bearer token from the request header

5 - Use the token to access other application endpoints, always observing the need for the correct role for the endpoint.
